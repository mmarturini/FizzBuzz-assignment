This is the think part of the TDD cycle, before writing the code, we write the tests.
Starting from the requirements of the software, we make a list of all possible tests to check these requirements
This list can also be written by hand for simplicity.

possible tests we can make
 - for 3 we get "Fizz"
 - for 1 we get "1"
 - print on stdout

Once we have a list of possible tests, choose one and implement it as a java class inside the test directory
